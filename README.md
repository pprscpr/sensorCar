# Sensor/Camera/Remote Controlled Car
This project was created as project work during my studies at the STB-Berlin. With the help of my fellow students Stefan Riedl and Tobias Buhn. It is a remote controlled car via Android App.
<br />There are available 3 modes :
* remote Controlled  
* follow a tracking object with the help of a camera,
* follow a black line on the ground with the help of IR-sensors
