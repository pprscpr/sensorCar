This project was created as project work during my studies at the STB-Berlin. With the help of my fellow students Stefan Riedl and Tobias Buhn. It is a remote controlled car via Android App. There are 3 modes -remote Controlled, -follow a tracking object with the help of a camera, -follow a black line on the ground with the help of IR-sensors.
